## building first app

go to vuejs.org -> install link

and you find different ways of creating a Vue project but the easiest way is not to install packages, but instead the easiest way to get started is by simply adding an import to the Vue package

create a index.html and app.js

in index.html:

```html

```

in app.js:

```javascript

```
