        <h2>1: How Vue updated the DOM</h2>

        <p>
          Vue only updated things that is changed and nothing else on the
          screen. Vue should not re-render the entire page every time something
          changes, but only the parts that did change. Now, how could Vue ensure
          that this is the case, that it does not re-render the entire screen.
          And Vue does that with a concept called the virtual DOM. It basically
          has a virtual copy of the real DOM. And when data changes, it
          basically just creates a new Virtual DOM you could say and compares
          the new Virtual DOM to the old Virtual DOM and only differences
          between those Virtual DOMS are written to the real DOM
        </p>

        <p>
          Vue instance: const vueApp = Vue.createApp(...); vueApp.mount("#app")
        </p>

        and that there are various steps for bringing something onto the screen
        Sometimes you need to run code during those steps
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          beforeCreate() and created(): The difference is that beforeCreate is
          basically called before the app has been fully initialized, whereas
          created is called thereafter. At this point of time we still have
          nothing on the screen though, After created Vue just knows its data
          properties
        </li>

        <li>
          Compile template: So where all the dynamic placeholders all the
          interpolations and so on are removed and replaced with the concrete
          values that should be shown to the user
        </li>

        <li>
          beforeUpdate and updated: This by the way, also means that at this
          point of time the update is visible on the screen So we don't reach
          mounted again because the template was never unmounted so it always
          was visible
        </li>

        <li>
          instance unmounted: When an app is unmounted all its content is
          removed from the screen and the app is dead. You can for example, use
          these hooks to execute any cleanup code you might wanna do.
        </li>
